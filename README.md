# rosalind_protein_mass
Calculates the monoisotopic mass of a protein.

This code is a solution to the Calculating Protein Mass (ID - PRTM) problem on the bioinformatics website Rosalind.

The program requires input of a text file listing the the 20 common amino acids in letter code and their corresponding mass, and a text file containing the peptide string to caluclate the mass of.

The program outputs the summed mass of the amino acid residues in the peptide string in Daltons to 3 decimal places.
